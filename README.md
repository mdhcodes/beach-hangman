[Beach Hangman](mdhcodes.github.io/beach-hangman)

This game uses key events to listen for the letters players type. 

When a player navigates to this website the following message is displayed: Press any key to get started!

Beach words stored in an array are randomly selected and spaces are displayed for each letter in that word. As the player guesses the correct letters, they are revealed.  

The following statistics are recorded during the game:

Wins: (# of times a player guesses the word correctly).

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the player).

Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the player has guessed are displayed).

After the player wins/loses, the game automatically selects another word from the array and the game restarts.
